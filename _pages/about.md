Hi! I am a student at the University of Chicago interested in computer science. This website serves as a centralized place to showcase my projects, creative ambitions, and personal opinions.

{: .text-justify}

Complicated issues that require clever problem solving fascinate me. Since a young age, I have involved myself with activities that incorporate these skills. I fell in love with chess and the myriad ways in which I could coordinate my pieces to outmaneuver an opponent. I competed in numerous chess tournaments and still actively play the game albeit on a more casual level (add me on chess.com @ flightlessemu). Chess involves theory and problem solving: the same attributes that have ignited my interest in computer science.

Practicing problem solving in the content we consume daily is also unexpectedly entertaining. I love the mystery of Easter eggs; nonsense anagrams like 'ekthemacc' that crack passwords or hidden widgets are rewarding to discover. The process of uncovering an Easter egg is arguably more satisfying then the Easter egg itself, which I think is true for problem solving in general.

In my free time, I play a lot of beach volleyball, although Chicago's weather sometimes does not cooperate. I also appreciate philosophy and its implications for daily living. Before I decided to study computer science, I actually planned on pursuing a degree in philosophy. I still actively study and write about philosophical issues that resonate with me. Overall, philosophy has made me a more skeptical person, which has enlightened my world views.

I am also invested in the fight against Alzheimer's. The disease has impacted my family, and I try to contribute as much as possible to an eventual discovery of a cure. I created/managed a company called PJ Pillows (we sold custom photo pillows to raise money for Alzheimer's research), and walk yearly with family and friends in the Walk to End Alzheimer's.

Ultimately, this website is a fun medium for expressing myself. It contains my academic pursuits, but also the less serious content that I find important.

A final cryptic tip: interpret the content of this website with your own creativity and maybe you can find an Easter egg. What's coming soon? Did you know Nero was the 5th Caesar of the Roman Empire?

Please enjoy.
