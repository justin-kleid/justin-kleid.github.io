Hi! I am a student at the University of Chicago interested in Computer Science. This website serves as a centralized place to express my projects, creative ambitions, and personal opinions. The contents, especially on the art page, reflect my favorite hobbies.

Complicated issues that require clever problem solving fascinate me. Since a young age, I have involved myself with hobbies that incorporate these skills. I fell in love with chess and the myriad ways in which I could coordinate my pieces to outmaneuver an opponent. I competed in numerous chess tournaments and still actively play the game albeit on a more casual level (friend me on chess.com @ flightlessemu). Computer Science and problem solving are inextricably linked, which makes it extremely interesting for me (despite the frustrating segfaults, etc).

Practicing problem solving in the content we consume daily is also unexpectedly entertaining. I love the mystery of easter eggs; nonsense anagrams like 'ekthemacc' that crack passwords or hidden widgets are rewarding to discover. The process of uncovering an easter egg is arguably more satisfying then the easter egg itself, which I think is true for problem solving in general.

In my free time, I play a lot of beach volleyball, although Chicago's weather is in often disagreement with this hobby. I also appreciate philosophy and its implications for daily living. Before I decided to study Computer Science, I actually planned on pursuing a philosophy major in college as my primary major. Regardless, I still actively learn and write about philosophical issues that resonate with me. Overall, philosophy has made me a more skeptical person, which has enlightened my world views.

I am also invested in the fight against Alzheimer's. The disease has impacted my family, and I try to contribute as much as possible to an eventual creation of a cure. I created/managed a company called PJ Pillows (we sold custom photo pillows to raise money for Alzheimer's research), and walk yearly with family and friends in the Walk to End Alzheimer's towards these ends.

Ultimately, this website is a fun medium for expressing myself. It contains my academic and professional pursuits, but also less serious content that I find important.

A final cryptic tip: interpret the content of this website with your own creativity and maybe find your own easter eggs here. Did you know Nero was the 5th Caesar of the Roman Empire?

Please Enjoy.
