The steady approach of midnight,  
Broods ominously overhead.  
I fear the ghastly sight,  
Of our forgotten loss and dread.  

{: .text-justify}

Yet hiding in the darkest shadows,  
Awaits a brilliant spectacle of light.  
As black and luster juxtapose,  
My shooting star begins its flight.  

{: .text-justify}

You are brilliant and splendid,  
A treasure built of my desire.  
The universe surely intended,  
To set my crimson heart afire.  

{: .text-justify}

As you traverse the night’s crest,  
Dancing on full display.  
I cast a wish, one dying request.  
My darling, won’t you stay?  

{: .text-justify}

But some wishes are in vain,  
Mere attempts at cathartic release.    
As your bright light starts to wane,  
I hope you find your peace.  

{: .text-justify}

As we tentatively depart,  
I shed an earnest tear.  
It reminisces for our hearts.  
Why must you disappear?  

{: .text-justify}

With memories fleeting fast,  
It is time to start anew.  
My wish is reborn at last,  
I hope the best for you.
