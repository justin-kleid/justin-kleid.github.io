Its metal is heavy; Its needle trembles. 
I hold a compass to my crimson heart, 
In the silence, truths unravel,
The echoes of a journey, about to start. 

{: .text-justify}

The compass gyrates, a fateful dance. 
I search for truth in its solemn gaze.  
The needle whispers, in a tense romance,
In its murmurs, fears ablaze.

{: .text-justify}

North was my guide, steadfast and true. 
A constant for me, my guiding role.
I followed obediently as I was taught to do.
Yet still, the South beckons for my soul.

{: .text-justify}

Why does this stirring unsettle my heart?
Is it fear of transgressing the status quo?
Or the dangers of a new, uncharted start,
Beyond what waits in known meadows.

{: .text-justify}

Oh, how I admire the compass’s dance,
Its carefree swirl, so elegant and pure.
Now I see, caught in its rhythmic trance,
Neither to North nor South, endless allure.

{: .text-justify}

In rhyme, in love, in life, structure rules all,
How binding are the rules in which we live.
Like the compass, my spirit takes its fall.
Spinning madly, nothing left to forgive.

{: .text-justify}

In my palm, the compass’s weight subsides:
Its quiet dance and my learning soul.
Across branching paths, we all question,
How to mend hearts torn before.
