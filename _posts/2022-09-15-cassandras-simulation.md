I wait a short while,     
My computer is online.   
I create a new file:   
A world to redefine.   

{: .text-justify}

 In my simulation,   
Lives all types of people.   
There are no altercations,    
Everyone is equal.    

{: .text-justify}

But in seconds for me,    
Their world ages centuries.    
They begin to disagree;   
The Utopia disappears.   

{: .text-justify}

Awash with fervent greed,   
Nations turn criminal.   
Calls for war are decreed;  
I watch, growing cynical.   

{: .text-justify}

Intransigent armies clash,  
Fighting rich men’s wars.  
Their trails leave ash,  
And corpses on the floor.  

{: .text-justify}

Pursuing ascendancy,   
Nations build up factories.   
These lethal tendencies,   
Clog the Earth’s arteries.   

{: .text-justify}

In a bright blinding blaze,   
Nukes end their final breaths.   
The menacing black and haze   
Reek of sulfur and death.   

{: .text-justify}

This world is like mine,   
Potential made obsolete.   
With a short defeated sigh,  
It ends; I click delete.
